zomato_df_final_data is the real-world dataset from Zomato, which contains more than 10K observations for restaurants in the Sydney area. Zomato, an Indian-founded restaurant aggregator, left Australia in February 2023 after struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this project is to help customers understand what factors make a restaurant good or bad, and to help them explore restaurants around them, for example, which suburb has the most Chinese restaurants.

- Machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering, including standardization and outlier removal.
- Model evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.

Logistic regression using 99% of the variance explained by PCA gives the best result, with 100% accuracy, which is a very good model
